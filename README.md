linear regression
A linear regression model describes the relationship between a dependent variable, y, and one or more independent variables, X. The dependent variable is also called the response variable. Independent variables are also called explanatory or predictor variables.
 For Regression algorithms we widely use mean_absolute_error, and mean_squared_error metrics to check the model performance.
